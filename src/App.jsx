      FNATIC has welcomed Ștefan "Sayonara" Mîtcu to the team for the rest of the current VCT offseason. He will specifically play with the team for their upcoming offseason events, as he is 16 years old and thus ineligible to play in the 2025 season.
      </h3>
      He will take the place of Leo "Leo" Jannesson at both Red Bull Home Ground in November and Riot Games ONE in December, as Leo remains inactive since June of this year due to health reasons. FNATIC stated in their announcement that Leo is preparing to return to the main roster for VCT 2025.
      <p>
      Sayonara is best known for his time with KPI Gaming in Challengers League Spain, where he played both duelist and initiator. Individually, the young star topped the league in Split 2 in almost every category with a 1.36 rating, 1.52 K:D ratio, 80% KAST, and 0.93 KPR. After winning Split 1, KPI finished third in Split 2 and attempted to fight their way into EMEA Ascension through the play-ins, but fell at the final hurdle to eventual third-place finishers CGN Esports.

      FNATIC spent their 2024 season continuing to lead EMEA regionally but struggling to maintain their international form after winning both LOCK//IN and Masters Tokyo in 2023. Their best result this year was a top-six finish at Champions in Seoul. Since then, they have bid farewell to Nikita "Derke" Sirmitev, who recently joined Team Vitality after over three years with FNATIC.
